					This page contains guidelines and Q/A for anyone interested to be supervised/mentored by me. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-reach-me">How to reach me</h2>
<p>It is important that you read this entire page first and clearly state it inside the email you will send to <a href="emailto:adrien.gruson@etsmtl.ca">me</a>. </p>
<p>In addition, it is important to provide some additional information inside this first email to maximize your chance of getting a reply from me. Especially if you want to get supervised by me, I would like to see the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your research interest? Why do you want to do some research (with me)?</li>
<li>What background experiences do you have to support this interest? A good example is to list your prior experience in computer graphics (e.g., classes, coding projects, previous research experience ...).</li>
<li>How do you see your interest align with mine? What kind of collaboration are you seeking? (Master, Ph.D., ...)</li>
</ul>
<p>A good idea is to include also your CV or/and a link to your personal website/GitHub inside this first email. In addition, I might request to also see your academic record to see which class you have taken in the past. </p>
<h2 id="research-topics">Research Topics</h2>
<p>My main expertise is in computer graphics and, more precisely, light transport simulation also called physically-based rendering. Rendering is the numerical process that takes as input a given scene description (surfaces, materials, light sources, and cameras) and simulates how the light gets propagated and scattered in a virtual environment to produce a physically-based rendered image. My research aims to reach the ideal rendering system that will be robust, high-performant, and easy to use for the artist. Please look at my publication page for more details on my (past) research.</p>
<p>Aside from doing research in forwarding rendering, I started to work on differentiable rendering and machine learning applied in graphics. I listed  below some of my current research topics that I am actively exploring:</p>
<p><strong>Exploiting and controlling correlation in rendering</strong>  is an efficient way to design robust estimators. For example, Markov-chains generate correlated samples that locally explore the integration space. Or, gradient-domain shift-mapping operators use positively correlated pairs of samples to estimate image space gradient. Thus, I strongly believe that correlation in rendering is a key to designing efficient sampling techniques. The key is to decide the right amount of correlation :) </p>
<p><strong>Designing more robust sampling routines with data-driven approaches</strong> is an important work area in light transport simulation. Too often, the proposed techniques rely on hard-coded decisions or complex user parameters which need to be properly set to get optimal performance. Therefore, I think it is important to move to more automatic approaches that leverage more scene input information (via machine learning) to improve the robustness of light transport algorithms. </p>
<p><strong>Improving the scalability of differentiable rendering</strong> is a key ingredient to unlock real applications of differentiable rendering. I believe this improvement needs to be made through designing new sampling strategies and/or new (continuous) scene representation.</p>
<p><strong>Exploring new volume rendering integration techniques</strong> by leveraging the higher integration dimensions possible inside the volume. </p>
<h2 id="common-questions-answers">Common questions &amp; answers</h2>
<p><strong>What work environment can I expect working with you at ÉTS?</strong></p>
<p>I strongly believe that an inclusive and good work environment is essential for performing research. I also think that collaborative work and exchanging ideas are crucial components to advancing in research. For these reasons, my students will be placed inside the common multimedia students' lab space, which regroups students from different professors on various topics. You can expect to have your own space and a dedicated working station with up-to-date specifications in this space. </p>
<p>You can also expect to get a weekly 1-on-1 meeting with me to discuss your progress and any related issue. I tend to work closely with my students (e.g., coding together, discussing papers, doing derivation on the whiteboard, etc...).  You can also expect that I organize other group events with students to spark discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Can I perform all my research activities remotely from home?</strong></p>
<p>One thing for sure: I will not micromanage you. I am normally flexible regarding your time inside the lab. However, I prefer that students regularly come to the lab to build a team spirit and encourage spontaneous discussions. Exclusive WFH can be accommodated in some individual cases for different reasons. </p>
<p><strong>Does I need funding/scholarship to be supervised by you?</strong></p>
<p>I have a simple rule: everybody needs to be paid for their work. So you can expect that if we decide to work together, you will receive some payment for your work. However, as you might know, funding can be a rare resource in research. So I will encourage and help you to apply for a scholarship before or during your studies. </p>
<p>Note that some scholarships do not cover your tuition fees. These fees can be important for international students. However, graduate students can get reduced tuition fees in some conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a problem if I am too weak in French?</strong></p>
<p>As you might know, French is the only official language in Quebec, and ÉTS is a french engineering school. However, you can pursue your graduate studies with only minimal French, and as Montreal is an international city, it is not required to know french to live here. </p>

<p><a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/%7Ethachisu/survival.pdf">Prof. Hachisuka's Graduate Study Survival Guide</a>: Describe many aspects of doing graduate studies in detail, including motivations, possible outcomes, and challenges. Highly recommended read! (note that he was one of my past post-doctoral supervisors)
