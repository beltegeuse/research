abstract = "In this paper we propose a method for recovering the shape (geometry) and the diffuse reflectance from an image (or video) using a hybrid setup consisting of a depth sensor (Kinect), a consumer camera and a partially controlled illumination (using a flash). The objective is to show how combining RGB-D acquisition with a sequential illumination is useful for shape and reflectance recovery. A pair of two images are captured: one non flashed (image under ambient illumination) and a flashed one. A pure flash image is computed by subtracting the non flashed image from the flashed image. We propose an novel and near real-time algorithm, based on a local illumination model of our flash and the pure flash image, to enhance geometry (from the noisy depth map) and recover reflectance information."
