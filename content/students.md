This page contains guidelines and Q/A for anyone interested to be supervised/mentored by me. 

## How to reach me

It is important that you read this entire page first and clearly state it inside the email you will send to [me](emailto:adrien.gruson@etsmtl.ca). 

In addition, it is important to provide some additional information inside this first email to maximize your chance of getting a reply from me. Especially if you want to get supervised by me, I would like to see the following:
* What is your research interest? Why do you want to do some research (with me)?  
* What background experiences do you have to support this interest? A good example is to list your prior experience in computer graphics (e.g., classes, coding projects, previous research experience ...).
* How do you see your interest align with mine? What kind of collaboration are you seeking? (Master, Ph.D., ...)

A good idea is to include also your CV or/and a link to your personal website/GitHub inside this first email. In addition, I might request to also see your academic record to see which class you have taken in the past. 

## Research Topics

My main expertise is in computer graphics and, more precisely, light transport simulation also called physically-based rendering. Rendering is the numerical process that takes as input a given scene description (surfaces, materials, light sources, and cameras) and simulates how the light gets propagated and scattered in a virtual environment to produce a physically-based rendered image. My research aims to reach the ideal rendering system that will be robust, high-performant, and easy to use for the artist. Please look at my publication page for more details on my (past) research.
 
Aside from doing research in forwarding rendering, I started to work on differentiable rendering and machine learning applied in graphics. I listed  below some of my current research topics that I am actively exploring:

**Exploiting and controlling correlation in rendering**  is an efficient way to design robust estimators. For example, Markov-chains can locally explore the path-space by applying small perturbations on the sampled paths. Another example is the gradient-domain shift-mapping operator, which leverages the positive correlation of a pair of paths when estimating the image space gradient. I want to continue pursuing my research in this area and see how to control this amount of correlation and introduce negative correlations. 

**Robust sampling strategies via data-driven approaches** Adhoc, and hard-coded decisions are often present in rendering algorithms, reducing efficiency to final algorithms. Data-driven or leveraging more information of the input will improve performance for such techniques. 

**Scalable differentiable rendering** 

**Efficient volume rendering** Variance in term of transmittance evaluation. Techniques that leverage correlation. Exploiting the higher dimension available inside the volume. 

## Common questions & answers

**What are the differences between Undergraduate and Graduate studies?**

passive learning. Clear assignment and tasks to do. Active learning, need to decide how you proceed. The answer to a particular problem that you will work on is often unclear at the start.   

**What difference I can expect between doing my research with you as Master or PhD?**

Master is often too short to complete a research topic by yourself. Often, continuing the work when starting PhD. More career options with PhD and better mobility. However, deciding to pursue a PhD is a rough adventure. For PhD contact me before doing any application. For PhD, you should be able to demonstrate your interest and potentially your past experience in computer graphics. 

## What work environment I can expect at Ã‰TS?

Student of my group will be placed inside the common multimedia's students lab space which regroup different professors on various topic. This environment will give you the opportunity to interact with other students. You can expect to have your own space and a dedicated working station with up-to-date specifications. I will also provide you access to Compute Canada Cluster ressources if you need more compute power. 

You can also expect to get weekly and dedicated 1-on-1 meeting with me to discuss about your progress and any related issue. There will be also some group meeting with other students. If you want to work in collaboration with other students, it is fine. I will also have opportunities to work with some external collaborators both from academia and industries. 

## Can I perform all my research activities remotely from home?

I am flexible regarding your time inside the lab. Exclusive WFH can be accommodated for in some cases, but I think it is important that students come regularly inside the lab because it give you opportunities to interact with other people and maybe that will passing by inside the lab. 

## Does I need funding/scholarship to be supervised by you?

I have a simple rule: If you should be paid for your work we do together. So you can expect that if you have a strong profile and I have adequate funding, I will fund you. However, as you might know but funding is a rare and important resource in research and I will encourage you to apply for a scholarship. 

Note that some scholarships do not cover your tuition fees. These fees can be important for international students. However, for graduate students, it exists possibility to get regular fees if enough course credit have been taken.  

## Is it a problem if I am not confident enough in my French or/and English skill?
